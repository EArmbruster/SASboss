# SASboss
Short jupyter notebooks to help visualize outputs from ATSAS packages PRIMUS and GNOM
PRIMUS_file_deconstruct.ipynb contains a couple of different tools that ease in the assessment of SAS data by breaking down multiple of PRIMUS or GNOM output (.out) files into a couple of ways to easier visualize and compare the P(r) fits you have made in ATSAS. Includes creating a .csv file with info from each fit (Rg, I(0), etc), Plotting Rg by Dmax, and pulling the SAS fit curve of your pair length distribution into a separate file in ASCII format in order to easily plot it over your data using a program other than ATSAS.
